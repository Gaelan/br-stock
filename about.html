  <h1>A Visual History of Railway Rolling Stock in Great Britain</h1>
  <p>by <a href="https://gaelan.me">Gaelan Steele</a>, with help</p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://gaelan.me/br-stock/">This page</a> attempts to visually
    represent the history of mainline railway passenger rolling stock in Great
    Britain, starting from the introduction of British Rail's TOPS
    classification system. I've also included London Underground rolling stock
    from a similar period, as the history of the two is in many cases
    intertwined.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each box represents a class of train (or, in a few cases, two very similar
    classes); boxes are placed horizontally according to the year(s) in which
    they were built. Arrows between boxes indicate that one train was based on
    another, in some way; this can range from the design for one specific part
    (say, the bogies), to a modification of the same overall design, to direct
    conversions of existing trains. Icons under each train indicate the
    companies (or sectors of British Rail) that have operated them; you can
    hover over an icon to see the operator's name and dates of operation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The nature of this format is that I can't capture everything; in some cases,
    a connection is present but there's no feasible way to draw an arrow. Within
    closely related families, the precise choice of where to draw the arrow is
    often somewhat arbitraryâ€”it's not particularly meaningful to ask, for
    instance, whether the class 720 is "based on" the design of the 710 or the
    345, as really they're all closely related iterations of the same design.
    I've also been somewhat capricious with the operator logos, in many cases
    omitting rebrands or leaving out distinctions between two operators
    continuing under the same brand; the intention here is to provide a rough
    indication of where a given train was used, not to precisely document the
    history of railway franchising.
    <strong>
      Please take everything here as a rough guide, not a definitive history.
    </strong>
    That being said, if you do think I've made the wrong call somewhere (or
    indeed am plain wrong!), do let me know!

    Information was gathered in the first instance from Wikipedia, which (while
    imperfect) seems to have by far the most comprehensive freely-available
    history of rolling stock. This was supplemented with a variety of sources,
    including the excellent
    <a href="https://www.bloodandcustard.com">Blood and Custard</a> and
    <a href="https://www.railcar.co.uk">RAILCAR.co.uk</a>. Much input was also
    provided by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/coastwaywill.me">Will</a> and
